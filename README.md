**First homework**: This code implements a linear regression model using TensorFlow to predict the relationship between the age of a machine (in months) and the mean time between failures (MTBF) in days. It uses supervised machine learning to train the model on the given dataset and visualizes the results.

**Second homework**: This Tesla stock regression model predicts the closing price of Tesla stock based on features like opening price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is trained to find relationships between the features and the target variable (closing price). The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess prediction accuracy.

**Third homework**: This code performs linear regression on the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. It splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, and predicts target values for the test set. It evaluates the model using metrics like coefficients, intercept, variance score (\[R^2\]), and mean squared error. Finally, it visualizes the predicted vs. actual target values in a scatter plot.
