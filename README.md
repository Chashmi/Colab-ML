First homework: This code implements a linear regression model using TensorFlow to predict the relationship between the age of a machine (in months) and the mean time between failures (MTBF) in days. It uses supervised machine learning to train the model on the given dataset and visualizes the results.

Second homework: This Tesla stock regression model predicts the closing price of Tesla stock based on features like opening price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is trained to find relationships between the features and the target variable (closing price). The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess prediction accuracy.
